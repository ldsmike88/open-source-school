# open-source-school
_Open Source School is to learning what Stack Overflow is to questions & answers._

This is going to be a platform where anyone can create material and vote on material. Not just narrative, but tests, quizzes, videos, etc. I came up with this idea thinking about teaching programming, but I'd like to see all sorts of subjects created (e.g. grade school subjects, higher education topics, technical learning, trades, specilized areas). 

I have a wife, kids, and a full-time job. I can't create this on my own, so I'll appreciate all the help I get.
